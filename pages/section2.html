            <h2>Nefertiti, The Beautiful One Has Come</h2>
            <h3>November 23, 1962</h3>
            <p>The 1962 release came to fruition when Taylor arrived at Europe with alto saxophonist <strong>Jimmy Lyons</strong> and drummer <strong>Sunny Murray</strong>. Bassist <strong>Henry Grimes</strong> fell short of the schedule due to an illness at the last moment. In Nov. 23, 1962, the trio assembled at the Cafe Montmartre in Copenhagen, Denmark where they live recorded the music (which was also designed by Jeff Hunt, mastered by Scott Colburn, and produced by Alan Bates. The music is comprised entirely of Taylor originals and is atonal and full of power, with the authors of <em>The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings</em> stating that the album "...should be accounted among the greatest live recordings in jazz. Taylor is still working his way out of jazz tradition and, with Murray at his heels, the playing has an irresistible momentum that creates its own kind of rocking swing, the pulse indefinable but palpable, the rhythm moving in waves from the drummer's kit. Lyons shapes his bebopper's vocabulary into gritty flurries of notes, a man caught in a squall and fighting his way through it and over it... Here he is sharing in the discovery of a fierce new world."</p>
