            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p><strong>Cecil Percival Taylor</strong> was born on March 25, 1929 in Long Island City, Queens, New York and raised in Corona, Queens, growing up in a two-family brick home. <strong>Percy Clinton Taylor</strong>, the father of Cecil, was head chef at the Rivercrest Sanitarium in Astoria, New York, often indulging in spirituals like 'Wade in the Water' and music by Louis Armstrong. <strong>Almeida Ragland Taylor</strong>, Cecil's mother, played piano, was an actress, and was a dancer who spoke French and German.
                His earliest contribution to music publication began as a professional jam-session musician in the early 1950s, forming a quartet with soprano saxophonist, Steve Lacy, drummer Dennis Charles, and the bassist Buell Neidlinger. In 1956, <strong><em>Jazz Advance</em></strong> was the first recording for Taylor's Quartet before going on to the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival to create the album <em><strong>At Newport</strong></em>. His later outputs were mused—an esoterical journey—Taylor's importance as a virtuoso and musical innovator was apparent— these many releases became seminal for pushing the boundaries of music. Although, these performances came with a detriment; bewildered fans and passerbys did not know what to expect from the artist's idiosyncratic style, making it complicated for Cecil to secure performance venues. Prior to those events, Taylor began improvising and composing by the age of 8 from as early as the age of 5, when he began piano lessons under the instruction of Almeida. He attended the New York College of Music until he had to leave for Massachusetts to graduate from the New England School of Music in 1953, where he recieved more classical and conservatory training in tune with contemporary European art music, which renown jazz musician Duke Ellington believed to be essential for future jazz students and the advancement of their skills. </p>

            <h2>Nefertiti, The Beautiful One Has Come</h2>
            <h3>November 23, 1962</h3>
            <p>The 1962 release came to fruition when Taylor arrived at Europe with alto saxophonist <strong>Jimmy Lyons</strong> and drummer <strong>Sunny Murray</strong>. Bassist <strong>Henry Grimes</strong> fell short of the schedule due to an illness at the last moment. In Nov. 23, 1962, the trio assembled at the Cafe Montmartre in Copenhagen, Denmark where they live recorded the music (which was also designed by Jeff Hunt, mastered by Scott Colburn, and produced by Alan Bates. The music is comprised entirely of Taylor originals and is atonal and full of power, with the authors of <em>The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings</em> stating that the album "...should be accounted among the greatest live recordings in jazz. Taylor is still working his way out of jazz tradition and, with Murray at his heels, the playing has an irresistible momentum that creates its own kind of rocking swing, the pulse indefinable but palpable, the rhythm moving in waves from the drummer's kit. Lyons shapes his bebopper's vocabulary into gritty flurries of notes, a man caught in a squall and fighting his way through it and over it... Here he is sharing in the discovery of a fierce new world."</p>

            <h2>Unit Structures</h2>
            <h3>October, 1966</h3>
            <p>After several years off records, pianist Cecil Taylor finally had an opportunity to document his music of the mid-'60s on two Blue Note albums (the other one was <strong><em>Conquistador</em></strong>). Taylor's high-energy atonalism fit in well with the free jazz of the period but he was actually leading the way rather than being part of a movement. In fact, this septet outing with trumpeter <strong>Eddie Gale</strong>, altoist <strong>Jimmy Lyons</strong>, <strong>Ken McIntyre</strong> (alternating between alto, oboe and bass clarinet), both <strong>Henry Grimes</strong> and <strong>Alan Silva</strong> on basses, and drummer <strong>Andrew Cyrille</strong> is quite stunning and very intense. In fact, it could be safely argued that no jazz music of the era approached the ferocity and intensity of Cecil Taylor's.</p>

            <h2>The Willisau Concert</h2>
            <h3>February, 2002</h3>
            <p>Since around 1970, in one sense Taylor, especially when playing solo, reiterates the same immensely deep composition time and time again. One hears almost the same motifs, usually subtly altered, a profound appreciation of the blues (if rarely directly stated), and an attack that, even if it had mellowed somewhat over the years, retained a hugely proud and rigorous character. Here, he battles a luxurious sounding Boesendorfer into submission, making rich use of its extra low notes; there's almost always a rumbling going on. His unyielding invention is at the forefront as he wrings variation upon sublime invention on his repository of melodic lines, never noodling about in search of inspiration, always somehow summoning it directly to his fingertips. The live performance is sliced into five sections. A lengthy main portion seemingly leaving no stone unturned is both beautiful and exhausting on it own. But then, as though Taylor realized there were things left unsaid, he launches into a stunning 13-minute postlude, breathtaking in its touch and level of emotion. In an embarrassment of riches, he adds three brief and exquisite addenda, achieving a delicacy and depth unmatched by any of his peers in the music. <strong><em>The Willisau Concert</em></strong> shows a grandmaster as yet unfazed by age, much less current fashion, and stands as one of Cecil Taylor's finest recordings.</p>
